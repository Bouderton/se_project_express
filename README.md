# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project is the Back End to the Full Stack Application I am building (What to Wear?). Main technologies used include Node, MongoDB, Express, and of course JavaScript. With everything set up, and after testing requests with Postman and MongoDB Compass, this full-stack app will be able to communicate with its very own API.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
